# Models
Some of the SOTA models and techniques used for predicting stock trends and prices include:

1. Prophet: A time series forecasting model developed by Facebook that uses additive models to forecast time series data based on an underlying trend and seasonal components, as well as user-provided input features and special events.
2. XGBoost: An implementation of gradient boosting decision trees that can be used for regression tasks, such as predicting stock prices. XGBoost is known for its high performance and scalability.
3. Random Forest: Another decision tree-based ensemble model that can be used for regression tasks, such as predicting stock prices. Random forests can handle noisy data and are good at capturing nonlinear relationships between the input features and output variable.
